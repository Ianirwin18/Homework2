# Homework2

First off I created the basic index.html and style.css need

I then added the title and main picture to be shown on the page

then I added the nav bar

After i added a bio and links to my email and other contact areas at the bottom of the page

Added place holder images for my later projects (still need to figure out the css for these tho)

made is so my top links move you to other parts of the page
